# HLF Chaincode CI Workflow

Just push to master and your chaincode and application will be deployed!
Supports any language built as long as you can get it in a Docker container running as "external chaincode", listening on port 7052.

## TODO
- Streamline experience, with well-defined application/chaincode structure.
- Automate cluster provisioning.
- Configurable HLF network topology.
